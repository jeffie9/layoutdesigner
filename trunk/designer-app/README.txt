Layout Designer v 0.1
---------------------

This application is an editor for model train layout designs. The 
designer lays out track pieces in sections on a virtual table top. 
In the scenery view, trains run on the layout. 

The project is hosted by SourceForge: http://layoutdesigner.sourceforge.net/ 

DEVELOPING
----------

This code is in very early stages of development and may not always 
compile.  This project was made in Eclipse, so that would be the 
easiest way to build the application.  The graphics require JDK 1.6 
(I am using version 1.6 update 21).
